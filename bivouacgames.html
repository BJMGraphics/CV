   <hr>
   <p>Bivouac Games are designed from scratch using graphic software, Unity game engine and C# for custom coding.</p>
   <p>All games are made in 2D with anime and manga style drawing and coloring. Graphics are hand drawn.</p>
   <P> The use of 3D softwre like Blender to make more realistic graphics is a posible option in which I must explore.</p>
